# nyc-housing-data-analysis
This is a repo for my independent study in Mathematics in the Fall of 2017, with Matthew Low as an advisor. The focus of this study is to explore and get started in basic machine learning. We will be using the NYC real estate dataset to perform exploratory data analysis and eventually build prediction models using regressions and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
